# Cutest Kitten Pageant

### Create an app so visitors can vote on who they think is the cutest kitten ever.

When the app loads, two kitten photos are randomly selected for the visitors to vote for the cutest kitten by clicking on the photo of the kitten.

After the visitor cast their vote, the winning kitten photo will be enlarged and framed. A bar chart will be displayed showing the number of votes the two kitten have had so far.

The visitor will be asked to vote for two new randomly selected kitten photos. The chart will be updated as votes are cast.
